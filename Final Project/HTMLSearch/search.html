	Search for a Job

<p>
	We're glad you decided to choose us to help you search for a job. Now it's time to settle in and tell us a little bit about yourself, your current job and what you're looking for. Please allot 30 to 60 minutes for the questionnaire. We will start by getting to know the work you're doing today. Then we will ask you about what you're hopinng to do for work tomorrow. Once we have this, you can check out and your job search will be under way! A few things to consider as you get started:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be sure you are in a quiet, comfortable place where you can focus</li>
	<li>Please fill every field out completely and be specific. The more specific you are, the more we can help</li>
	<li>Block off 30-60 minutes to complete the search forms</li>
</ul>
