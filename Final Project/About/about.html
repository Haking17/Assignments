<h2>
	We're here to give you your time back
</h2>
	<p>
		The JobShop was started based on the insight that job seekers need help in managing what can often times feel like a challenging search process. The average job search lasts about 6 weeks and much of the time prior to interviewing is spent researching opportunities and filling out legnthy applications that in some cases can take up to an hour to complete. Time is of the essence whe searcing for the next great role and we believe in giving you back some of the time you spend searching and applying so that you can focus on higher value activities like networking, preparing for interviews or getting a little R&R in when the search becomes stressful.</p>

		<p>It works like this. You share some basic information about the work you're doing today and what you hope your next role looks like. Then we take a week to search for jobs for you. At the end of that week we'll send you a list of jobs that we found that meet your criteria. You tell us which ones you're interested in and we apply on your behalf. Simple! </p>

	We believe your time is valuable. Let us spend the time researching roles and applying to jobs for you. Get started today.
